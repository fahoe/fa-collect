This prog (fa_collect) collect the udp streams, one thread per device , push it to an additional thread, who mix the streams to a libera grouping protocol, which  feed the data to the std. archiver.  
There are no changes compared to last yearâ€™s(02/2024) status. If this program continues to be used by us, I will make it a bit more robust in case a stream fails.
